Recreating cave story based on this walkthrough here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IufkC1IRY2Q&list=PL006xsVEsbKjSKBmLu1clo85yLrwjY67X. 
Using SDL2 instead of SDL because that was what was installed on my laptop. Also trying to use some more modern c++ stuff like std::unique_ptr 
instead of boost::scoped_ptr and such, but idrk much about coding in c++ or coding in general tbh so I'm just trying stuff and learning rn.
I'm compiling using c++ 23, but I'm pretty sure that I'm not using a lot of c++ 23 features and stuff. Lowkey my first time using a lot of
c++ stuff like smart pointers so mostly just trying to learn and stuff.
